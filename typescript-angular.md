# TypeScript + AngularJS

In the last years AngularJS has stablished itself as the most popular Front-end framework due to features like Data Binding, HTML enhancement, AJAX, and built-in testability. Nevertheless, the open web has boosted the period in which new technologies appear.

Just as this entry is being written a new version of [Angular](http://angularjs.blogspot.mx/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html) is being released, which adopted two unstoppable trends in the current year, components and TypeScript. The reason for adopting them is mostly scalability since JavaScript and DOM can get very complicated to manage in modern web applications. This is a list of TypeScript features that makes it a great tool for JavaScript development.

## IDE Autocompletion

In the past when it came to JavaScript the IDEs were not very helpful, autocompletion and suggestions were based on what you previously typed, not to talk about methods description or return type. A workaround to this was to install extra modules to the IDE or write references. With typescript you have extensive support for modules, libraries and DOM methods.
